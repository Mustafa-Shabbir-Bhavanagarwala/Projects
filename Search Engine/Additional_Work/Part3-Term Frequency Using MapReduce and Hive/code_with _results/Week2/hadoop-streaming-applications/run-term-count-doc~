# This is a template for running Hadoop streaming jobs.
#   * An "application" is a mapper and a reducer, and also specifies the output location
#      (for example word-count)
#   * Create a directory with the name of the application
#   * Within that directory the mapper code is in a file with name 'mapper'
#      The reducer code is in a file with name 'reducer'

# First argument is the application name (the directory with mapper and reducer).
# Second argument is input directory in HDFS.  Relative to /input
# Third argument is output directory in HDFS.  Relative to /output
