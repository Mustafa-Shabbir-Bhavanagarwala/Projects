1)Does the average gain differ for flights that departed late versus those that did not? What about for flights that departed more than 30 minutes late?

->for flights that departed late versus those that did not


NULL: meanGain_departedLate=meanGain_departedNotLate
ALTERNATIVE: meanGain_departedLate!=meanGain_departedNotLate

As our sample size is large, we can use t test for entire project

```{r}
t.test(net_gain~late,data=UAflights, alternative = "two.sided") 
```
As p value is < than 0.05, so reject null hypothesis
There is evidence for mean gain of departed late flights different from mean gain of not departed late flights

```{r}
latef<-UAflights %>%
  filter(late=="TR")
ggplot(data = latef, mapping = aes(x = net_gain)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
```

```{r}
notLate<-UAflights %>%
  filter(late=="FA")
ggplot(data = notLate, mapping = aes(x = net_gain)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
```

Based on shape of above two graphs, average gain may differ for flights that departed late versus those that did not

3)Another common measure of interest, in addition to total gain, is the gain relative to the duration of the flight. Calculate the gain per hour by dividing the total gain by the duration in hours of each flight. Does the average gain per hour differ for flights that departed late versus those that did not? What about for flights that departed more than 30 minutes late?

```{r}
#glimpse(UAflights)
```
```{r}
#View(UAflights)
```


```{r}
UAflights <- UAflights %>% 
  mutate(duration_in_hours = air_time/60)
```

```{r}
UAflights <- UAflights %>% 
  mutate(gain_per_hour = net_gain/duration_in_hours)
```

```{r}
#glimpse(UAflights)
```

->Does the average gain per hour differ for flights that departed late versus those that did not?


NULL: meanGainPerHour_late=meanGainPerHour_notLate
ALTERNATIVE: meanGainPerHour_late!=meanGainPerHour_notLate

```{r}
t.test(gain_per_hour~late,data=UAflights, alternative = "two.sided") 
```
As p value<0.05, we reject null hypothesis
We have evidence that mean Gain per hour for flights departed late differs from mean gain per hour for flights did not depart late

```{r}
#glimpse(UAflights)
```


```{r}
latef<-UAflights %>%
  filter(late=="TR")
ggplot(data = latef, mapping = aes(x = gain_per_hour)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
```

```{r}
latef<-UAflights %>%
  filter(late=="FA")
ggplot(data = latef, mapping = aes(x = gain_per_hour)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
```
Based on shape of above graphs,the average gain per hour may differ for flights that departed late versus those that did not

->What about for flights that departed more than 30 minutes late?

NULL: meanGainPerHour_moreThan30late=meanGainPerHour_notMoreThan30Late
ALTERNATIVE: meanGainPerHour_moreThan30late!=meanGainPerHour_notMoreThan30Late
```{r}
t.test(gain_per_hour~very_late,data=UAflights, alternative = "two.sided") 
```

As p value<0.05, we reject null hypothesis
We have evidence that mean gain per hour for flights departed more than 30 mins late is different from mean gain per hour for flights departed not more than 30 mins late

```{r}
latef<-UAflights %>%
  filter(very_late=="TR")
ggplot(data = latef, mapping = aes(x = gain_per_hour)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
```

```{r}
latef<-UAflights %>%
  filter(very_late=="FA")
ggplot(data = latef, mapping = aes(x = gain_per_hour)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
```
Based on shape of above graphs,the average gain per hour may differ for flights that departed more than 30 minutes late versus those that did not

4)Does the average gain per hour differ for longer flights versus shorter flights?

```{r}
#View(UAflights)
```
```{r}
#unique(UAflights$duration_in_hours)
```

```{r}
max(UAflights$duration_in_hours)
min(UAflights$duration_in_hours)
```
```{r}
#glimpse(UAflights)
```

```{r}
short_long<-UAflights %>%
  filter((duration_in_hours<=3) | (duration_in_hours>=6))
#short_long
```
```{r}
#glimpse(short_long)
```

```{r}
short_long <- short_long %>% 
  mutate(
    shorter_flight=ifelse(duration_in_hours<=3, "TR", "FA")
    
  )
```

NULL:  average gain per hour for longer flights=average gain per hour for shorter flights
ALTERNATIVE: average gain per hour for longer flights!=average gain per hour for shorter flights
```{r}
#glimpse(short_long)
```

```{r}
t.test(gain_per_hour~shorter_flight,data=short_long, alternative = "two.sided") 
```

As p value<0.05, we reject null
We have evidence for average gain per hour for longer flights different from average gain per hour for shorter flights

```{r}
#glimpse(short_long)
```

```{r}
latef<-short_long %>%
  filter(shorter_flight=="TR")
ggplot(data = latef, mapping = aes(x = gain_per_hour)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
```
```{r}
latef<-short_long %>%
  filter(shorter_flight=="FA")
ggplot(data = latef, mapping = aes(x = gain_per_hour)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
```

Based on shape of above graphs, average gain per hour may differ for longer flights versus shorter flights
