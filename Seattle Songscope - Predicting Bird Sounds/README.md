<h1 align="center">Seattle Songscope: Predicting Bird Sounds </h1>

<p align="right"><b>By: Mustafa Shabbir Bhavanagarwala</b></p>

## Overview
<p>In this project Neural Networks are made use to classify bird sounds from various bird species found in the Seattle area. Spectograms are the bases to train and test the machine learning models. There are total of twelve bird species data available in the form of spectograms. Two kinds of classifications are done which are binary and multi-class. The classification results are evaluated based on plots for Epoch vs Loss and Epoch vs Accuracy. Custom neural 
networks are developed and compared across various structures and hyperparameters 
to achieve optimal performance. The binary classification is done between two bird species which are Blue Jay versus Barn Swallow, while multi-class classification is carried out for all the twelve species.
<br>
The technology used to carry out the project is Python. This project aids wildlife conservation, ecological 
research, and urban planning by automatically identifying bird species through sound. It 
supports species monitoring, biodiversity studies, and environmental impact 
assessments, while enhancing birdwatching apps and educational tools, fostering public 
engagement and sustainable development.
