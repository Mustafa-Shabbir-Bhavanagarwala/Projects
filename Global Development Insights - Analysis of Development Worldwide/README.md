## Overview


<p>
This project aims to analyze and uncover the global development trends, aiming to provide insights into the economic, social, and environmental factors that influence the well-being of societies worldwide. By analyzing key socioeconomic and demographic indicators, this project seeks to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships that can inform decision-making and promote sustainable growth. The data analyzed in this project is sourced from the World Development Indicators (WDI) database, a comprehensive and trusted resource developed by the World Bank. The WDI database is renowned for its high-quality, consistent data spanning over 1,600 indicators and more than 200 countries. The data is subsetted, cleaned and imputed. As the data is time series, the appropriate imputation method implemented is Kalman Filter. Trends in a number of significant factors are analyzed and uncovered such as relationship between mortality rates and health expenditure as a percentage of GDP across various countries, correlation between government expenditure on education and infant mortality rate and tourism expenditure trends for various countries over recent years.</p>
<p>Several insights have been uncovered, some of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demographic Shifts: Varied percentage changes in population, with growth dominating in Africa and Asia, variation due to economic development, urbanization, and fertility rate differences. Global birth rates declining influenced by factors like education and healthcare access</li>
<li>Infrastructure & Access: High progress in electricity access is seen in developing nations like Ethiopia and Bangladesh, reducing energy inequality</li>
<li>Economic Trends: Global decline in agriculture(% GDP), while government spending on education and health shows varied national priorities. Tourism expenditure is growing, highlighting its increasing contribution to economies like India, Kenya & China</li>
<li>Health & Well-being: Mortality rates decrease with higher health and education expenditure, indicating importance of education & healthcare investments</li>
<li>Geopolitical Priorities: Variation in trends of Armed forces reflect defense priorities, modernization, and geopolitical strategies</li>
<ul>

<p>The technology used to develop the project is R. The project is used to enhance cybersecurity for companies, increase Email and Browser Security, Fraud Prevention, Secure Transactions & Brand Protection. With the help of the project, email softwares could potentially be enhanced 
with features to notify a user if a link looks suspicious. So, if an account within the organization 
gets compromised and starts sending phishing emails, instead of relying on the usersâ€™ skills to be 
able to catch it, they would be assisted by this feature before clicking the link.</p>
