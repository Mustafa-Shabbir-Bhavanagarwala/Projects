## Overview

<p>This project involves analyzing and understanding the variations in heart disease and stroke 
mortality data among US adults based on factors such as Year, Type of Heart Disease, Age, 
Gender, Race/Ethnicity. Here the data is preprocessed, variations are analyzed, relations are 
studied & based on the findings, predictive models with necessary variables are built to 
forecast mortality rates of U.S population having different heart diseases. The models 
implemented are Linear Regression and XGB Regressor. The latter one came out to be a 
better model with an excellent R2 score of 0.939. Python is used to develop the project. </p>

<p> The project is a critical public health initiative as 
it helps healthcare authorities and policymakers allocate resources, design targeted 
interventions, and develop preventive strategies to combat the most vulnerable diseases 
more effectively.</p>
