<h1 align="center">United Airines(UA) Advanced Analysis Based On departure delays & Gain Per Flight</h1>

<p align="right"><b>By: Mustafa Shabbir Bhavanagarwala</b></p>

## Overview
<p>This project makes use of nycflights13 package which is a part of the R programming language ecosystem. The United Airlines flight data is analyzed. The relationship between departure delays and variables like time of day, time of year, temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and visibility are investigated using graphical analysis and permutation tests. The Null and the Alternative hypothesis are framed and the p-value is computed to carry out the hypothesis testing and decision making. </p>

<p>Further on, net gain per flight, that is, how much 
quicker the flight ended up being than planned is examined, considering factors such as flight duration and late departures. The analysis employs t-tests to explore differences in average gain for flights departed late vs flights departed on time.  Confidence intervals & mean are implemented to find the most common destination airports for United Airlines flights from New York City. T-tests are also used to find if average gain per hour differs for flights that departed late versus those that did 
not. Additionally t-tests are used to find if average gain per hour differs for longer flights versus shorter flights.</p>

<p>The technology used to implement the project is R programming Language. The analysis implemented in the project helps in better resource allocation and scheduling by the airlines.</p>
