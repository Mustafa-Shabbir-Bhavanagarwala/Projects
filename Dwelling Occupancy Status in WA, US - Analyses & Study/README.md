<h1 align="center">The Occupancy Equation: Analyses & Study of Dwelling Occupancy Status in the Washington State, US</h1>

## Overview
<p>This project utilizes IPUMS USA which contains harmonized census and American Community Survey (ACS) 
data, encompassing variables related to individuals and housing, such as age, income, 
housing cost, and population density. Here dwelling occupancy status (owner or renter) 
is analysed & predicted based on various factors. Support vector models (SVM) is analysed and decided upon to implement the project. Three different kernels are implemented of the 
Support Vector Classifier, cross validation is done to tune the parameters, and feature 
extraction is done to achieve the best results. </p>

<p>The project estimates dwelling occupancy 
status, which helps to understand housing dynamics, guiding policy decisions, market 
analysis, and resource allocation. After implementing the three kernals of the Support 
Vector Classifier which are linear, polynomial, and radial, the radial kernel achieved the 
highest test accuracy of 82.64%, followed by linear kernel with test accuracy of 81.36% 
and then the polynomial kernel with test accuracy of 80.03%. So it appears that Support 
Vector Classifier with radial kernel is the best model to predict ‘dwelling occupancy status 
(owner or renter)</p>
