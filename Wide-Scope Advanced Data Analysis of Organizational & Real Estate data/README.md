## About the Project
<p>This section involves analyzing several datasets, where each of the tasks is analyzed using Excel, involving fundamentals from the Statistics(Descriptive, Inferential) and Data Analysis domain. Several topics are involved in data driven decisions and analysis such as
<ul>
<li>Measures of central tendency, asymmetry, and variability</li>
<li>Correlation and covariance</li>
<li>Confidence intervals</li>
<li>Regression analysis</li>

<li>Working with different types of distributions</li>
<li>Hypothesis testing</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p> A Number of techniques for understanding the data are implemented, such as Frequency distribution tables, Bar charts, Pie charts, Pareto diagrams, histograms, Cross tables, and Scatter plots. The concepts like mean, median, mode, skewness, variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and covariance are used to help understand data patterns, trends, and relationships, thus providing a foundation for making data-driven decisions, identifying insights & providing a structured understanding of the datasets. The range of true population parameters for the data is estimated using Confidence intervals. Support/reject of claims about population parameters for the data are determined using Hypothesis testing. </p>
