<h1 align="center">PhishGuard: Advanced Analysis & Prediction of Malicious URLs</h1>

<p align="right"><b>By: Mustafa Shabbir Bhavanagarwala</b></p>

## Overview
<p>Preventing phishing attacks can improve cybersecurity for companies and keep user or 
corporate data safe from hackers. This research investigates if there are characteristics of 
uniform resource locators (URLs) that distinguish legitimate websites from phishing websites 
designed to steal user credentials, and if these features can be used to predict a URL is for a 
phishing website quickly in an application, like email software. Unsupervised learning was 
performed on features of the URLs to find patterns, and learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, 
Random Forests, XGB Classifier and Support Vector Machines were used to determine how well phishing URLs 
could be predicted and what variables were most important for those predictions. The results 
showed that the variables about URL length, number of digits, number of letters, number of special 
characters like ampersands described the variance in the URLs the most and contributed the 
most to predicting if URLs were legitimate or not. Specifically, longer URLs with more complex 
characters tend to be phishing URLs. In addition, the Random Forest model was able to predict 
phishing URLs with 91% accuracy</p>

<p>The technology used to develop the project is Python. The project is used to enhance cybersecurity for companies, increase Email and Browser Security, Fraud Prevention, Secure Transactions & Brand Protection. With the help of the project, email softwares could potentially be enhanced 
with features to notify a user if a link looks suspicious. So, if an account within the organization 
gets compromised and starts sending phishing emails, instead of relying on the users’ skills to be 
able to catch it, they would be assisted by this feature before clicking the link.</p>
