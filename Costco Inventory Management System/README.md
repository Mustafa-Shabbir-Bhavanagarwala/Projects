<h1 align="center">Costco Inventory Management System</h1>

## About the Project
<p>Costco is the third-largest retailer in the world. For the proper functioning and success of 
the corporation in a locality, a well-defined inventory management system forms the 
backbone of the organization. The large amount of data owned by the organization should 
be safely stored, well maintained, and rapidly accessible by its database. Thus the project 
aims to deliver an inventory management system that involves implementing a robust 
database thereby ensuring seamless management of the vast inventory, ensuring 
accuracy, and real-time insights which would enhance the overall supply chain, reduce 
costs, and elevate the customer experience. The database is characterized by features 
such as efficient storage, data integrity, and performance optimization. Through the
project, the aim is to empower Costco to navigate the challenges of inventory 
management with confidence, resilience, and unparalleled efficiency, making a lasting 
impact on the success and sustainability of the organization.</p>
<p>In this project, SQL is used to build and manage the database. First the requirements for 
the Costco inventory are gathered to understand the data that needs to be managed.
Then a well defined ER diagram is built to model the data and its relationships based on 
the requirements. Now forward engineering is carried out to create actual database 
schema in a DBMS, followed by implementing indexes, constraints, and other database 
objects. The database is then populated with inventory data. Several significant SQL 
queries are built and executed upon the database. To reduce redundancy, and improve 
performance and security stored procedures are implemented. Tkinter is used to create 
the user interface to allow users to interact with the database</p>
