<h1 align="center">Seattle Songscope: Identifying Bird Sounds </h1>

<p align="right"><b>By: Mustafa Shabbir Bhavanagarwala</b></p>

## Overview
<p>In this project Neural Networks are implemented and finalized to classify bird sounds from various bird species found in the Seattle area. Spectrograms are the basis for training and testing the machine learning models. There is a total of twelve bird species data available in the form of spectrograms. Two kinds of classifications are done which are binary and multi-class. The classification results are evaluated based on plots for Epoch vs Loss and Epoch vs Accuracy. Custom neural 
networks are developed and compared across various structures and hyperparameters 
to achieve optimal performance. The binary classification is done between two bird species which are Blue Jay versus Barn Swallow, while multi-class classification is carried out for all the twelve species.

The technology used to carry out the project is Python. This project aids wildlife conservation, ecological 
research, and urban planning by automatically identifying bird species through sound. It 
supports species monitoring, biodiversity studies, and environmental impact 
assessments, while enhancing birdwatching apps and educational tools, fostering public 
engagement and sustainable development. Future enhancements could include incorporating transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGGish or YAMNet, which are specifically designed for audio data. Additionally, integrating data augmentation techniques for spectrograms and exploring recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers to capture temporal dependencies in bird sounds can improve model performance.
