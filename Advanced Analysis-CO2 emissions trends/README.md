About the Project
This project is based on the CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset, which is used to analyze CO2 emissions trends over the years 1970 to 2020 for the top 10 CO2 emitter countries in the year 2020. The dataset is a greenhouse gas emission data set from 'Our World in Data' to describe how the emission levels of the current top 10 CO2 emitters have changed over the last 50 years (1971 - 2020). The dataset contains variables such as country, year, and CO2. The important features are extracted from the dataset and are carried forward for analysis. The link to the dataset is https://github.com/owid/co2-data. Through this project, a well-advanced analysis is carried out to analyze CO2 emissions trends for the top 10 CO2 emitter countries through plot visualizations such as Hist plot, Box plot, & Line plot accompanied by conversion to log scale for better analysis.
